# Football_Heads

"Football_Heads" is a football game that involves exciting head-to-head duels.
(i.e. controlling only the player's head). The game offers a slightly unusual approach to control and gameplay - instead of controlling an entire player or team, you will control only the head of a selected character. The player's task is to use their skills and reflexes to score as many goals as possible and claim victory. The uniqueness of the game is that it allows you to competition between two players on the same device. As a result, the game can be enjoyed by both children and adults.
